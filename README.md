### If you wish to add poweful metrics to you app - you are at the right place

#### usage:

* install: `npm i -S eye-of-sauron` or `yarn add eye-of-sauron`
* then in your main file add in the top: `import 'eye-of-sauron';` you will be able to access `window.eyeOfSauron` and trigger `window.eyeOfSauron.init()` later, or you can use another approach: `import EyeOfSauron from 'eye-of-sauron';` and just call it as simple as `EyeOfSauron()`, soon you will be able to pass configuration object as an argument
* set `VISUALISE_EVENTS` environment variable as `true` if you wish to show all metrics traces on your screen.

#### package is at it's early development stage but it will change everything soon...
